I have added all of the html for the landing page. I am in the process of styling everything and am nearing completion of the landing page. (For mobile anyways)

I design mobile first then move up to bigger device viewports (ie. tablet, laptop, desktop displays) As this is the most efficient way to design a website.

I attempted to copy everything from wix however their system is very bloated and they inject the pages and styling inside of a webapp. Meaning copy paste was not possible. Everything has been redone from scratch.

I have fixed a lot of the styling errors from the wix site. Will be adding new styling from discussions about what would be nice for the repair sections.
